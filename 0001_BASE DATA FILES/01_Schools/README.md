This folder contains the Jupyter notebooks used to generate the global school location dataset from raw OSM data.

Due to file size constraints, the full set of OSM data files and interim results is stored externally and not included here. For access to all input files to be able to run the notebooks on your machine, see the [SRI Base Data Library](https://olewelo.thegood.cloud/s/WE4TZLmzdXqrxKS). A separate readme explains the different files.
